## 👋 Hi, I’m Ibraam

- 🔭 I build machine learning projects that turn research into useful real-world tools.
- 🧠 My work includes an RL trading bot, a legal RAG assistant using LLMs, and a movie genre classifier.
- 🌱 Currently diving into Computer Vision for my upcoming research internship.
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on innovative ML/NLP/CV projects — especially ones pushing LLMs or autonomous agents forward.
- 🛠️ Tech: Python · PyTorch · Hugging Face · OpenCV · Git · Transformers · RL · RAG
